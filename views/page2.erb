<h3>You are now at the beginning of the cave entrance. You notice in a pile of rubble a small glimmer. As you walk over to the rocks, you notice it is a small key partially burried under the rocks and dirt. Using your sword you dig out the key.

*This key might be useful later so perhaps you should add it to your inventory. But wait! There seems to be a problem with your bag! When you place the key inside it disappears. You need to find a way to save your key with the rest of your belongings.* You have the beginning of an idea, but its not quite complete. See if you can remember what you were thinking. </h3>
