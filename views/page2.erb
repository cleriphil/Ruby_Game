<h3>You are now at the entrance of a large cave system. You notice in a pile of rubble a small glimmer. As you walk over you notice it is a small key partially buried under rocks and dirt. Using your sword you dig out the key.

This key might be useful later so perhaps you should add it to your inventory. But wait! There seems to be a problem with your bag! When you place the key inside it disappears. You need to find a way to save your key with the rest of your belongings. You have the beginning of an idea, but its not quite complete. See if you can remember what you were thinking. </h3>
