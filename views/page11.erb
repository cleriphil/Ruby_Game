Oh my! There is a wizard in our path! He appears to be protecting the door to the chamber that has the sacred ruby. You duck behind a rock and hide while you observe what he is doing. You realize he is reading from scripts and chanting evil spells to create a barrier around the door. Oh look, he's getting a drink of water! Now is our chance to stop him from continuing his spells! How can we do that? Hmm, it looks like the scripts are in a particular order....</h3>
