  As you walk confidently into the monsters chamber in search of the ruby, you lose some of your confidence as you see a monster 10x your size between you and the ruby. The monster points it's clawed hand at you and says; "I am the mighty <em>Nil</em>iathan! The ruby belongs to me and anyone who tries to take it will be .destoryed!"</h3>
  <h3> You take out your enchanted sword to do battle with the monster. It seems like it would take more than a few strikes to kill <em>Nil</em>iathan, but make sure to be measured in your approach...
<br>
  *Hint: the monster is a string*
